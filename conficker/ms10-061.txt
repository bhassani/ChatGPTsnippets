The Print Spooler service in Microsoft Windows XP,Server 2003 SP2,Vista,Server 2008, and 7, when printer sharing is enabled,
-- |       does not properly validate spooler access permissions, which allows remote attackers to create files in a system directory,
-- |       and consequently execute arbitrary code, by sending a crafted print request over RPC, as exploited in the wild in September 2010,
-- |       aka "Print Spooler Service Impersonation Vulnerability."
