/*
This example uses the Windows API functions like OpenProcess and ReadProcessMemory to read the memory of a specified process and write it to a binary file. 
The processId variable should be replaced with the actual process ID you want to dump, and outputFile should be replaced with the desired output file path.

Keep in mind that manipulating or extracting data from processes can have serious consequences, and it's important to adhere to legal and ethical standards. 
Unauthorized access or manipulation of system processes can lead to security vulnerabilities and legal consequences. 
Always ensure that you have the appropriate permissions and legal authorization before attempting such operations.
