/*
Perform MX Query:
Use an external API or service to perform the MX query, as iOS doesn't provide direct support for DNS queries.

Connect to SMTP Server:
Use the URLSession in Swift to make HTTP requests to an SMTP server. You may need to use a third-party library for more advanced SMTP interactions.

Read File and Convert to Base64:
Use Data(contentsOf:) to read the contents of a file, and then use base64EncodedString() to convert it to base64.

Embed Attachment in Email:
Add the base64-encoded content as an attachment to the email being sent.
